# My React Project with Vite

This project is a React application set up using Vite. It includes Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and some ESLint rules to ensure code quality.

## Overview

This project demonstrates a minimal setup to get React working with Vite. It leverages the power of Vite for fast development and build times, and includes configurations for ESLint to maintain code standards.

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I learned:
- How to set up a React project using Vite.
- The benefits of using Vite for fast development and build processes.
- How to configure and use ESLint to enforce coding standards.
- The differences between using Babel and SWC for Fast Refresh in React.

## Plugins Used

Currently, two official plugins are available and used in this project:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh.
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh.
